# Notes Project

## Overview
This project is a **Personal Notes application** built with Java and JavaFX for the user interface, and MariaDB for data persistence.  
The goal of the application is to allow users to create, manage, and organize notes in a simple but structured way.

## Technology Stack

### **Java**
- Chosen because we are currently studying Java, which ensures consistency with our coursework.  
- Using Java avoids confusion by keeping the whole project aligned with the language we are focusing on.  
- It also provides strong object-oriented features suitable for building structured applications.  

### **JavaFX**
- Chosen as the UI framework since it is a Java-based technology.  
- We have prior experience with JavaFX from earlier assignments, which makes development more efficient.  
- Provides a clean way to build interactive and modern user interfaces.  

### **MariaDB**
- Chosen as the database solution because the teacher specifically requires an SQL database.  
- Our whole group has already used MariaDB before, so the setup and usage are familiar.  
- Reliable, open-source, and integrates smoothly with Java applications via JDBC.

## Features (Planned)
- Add, edit, and delete notes.  
- Organize notes by categories or tags.  
- Store notes persistently in MariaDB.  
- Simple and clear user interface with JavaFX.

## Reasoning Summary
- **MariaDB**: Required SQL database + team experience.  
- **Java**: Matches current course focus and avoids confusion.  
- **JavaFX**: Familiar Java-based UI toolkit we have used before.
